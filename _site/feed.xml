The main focus of the research is two-fold: autonomous learning from observations in daily life and cognitive robot control. In order to realize an intuitive robot and to satisfy humans expectations for a robotic companion, we study about human beings and transfer the discovered mechanisms to robotic systems. In this way, the robot can learn new skills without engineers programming and learn complicate tasks incrementally in a generalized framework. Especially by bridging learning from observations, robot motor control, and learning from self practices, robots will be capable of performing complex tasks robustly under uncertainties.</subtitle></feed>
